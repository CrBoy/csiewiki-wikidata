瀏覽
====

最簡單的瀏覽方式就是點選頁面中的 wiki 連結，可在 wiki 頁面之間切換。
點選導覽選單中的「首頁」可直接回到 wiki 首頁。
「所有頁面」則會顯示本站所有 wiki 頁面，若頁面在目錄中，則會顯示目錄，你可以點選目錄進到下一層。
除此之外，你也可以使用搜尋功能尋找你要的資料。
需要注意的是，如果你搜尋的是英文單字，必須完整打出。如「gremlins」不可以打成「gremlin」。
最後，「前往」的功能可以讓你直接連結到你指定的頁面。

Creating and modifying pages
============================

Registering for an account
--------------------------

In order to modify pages, you’ll need to be logged in. To register for
an account, just click the “register” button in the bar on top of the
screen. You’ll be asked to choose a username and a password, which you
can use to log in in the future by clicking the “login” button. While
you are logged in, these buttons are replaced by a “logout so-and-so”
button, which you should click to log out when you are finished.

Note that logins are persistent through session cookies, so if you don’t
log out, you’ll still be logged in when you return to the wiki from the
same browser in the future.

Editing a page
--------------

To edit a page, just click the “edit” button at the bottom right corner
of the page.

You can click “Preview” at any time to see how your changes will look.
Nothing is saved until you press “Save.”

Note that you must provide a description of your changes. This is to
make it easier for others to see how a wiki page has been changed.

Page metadata
-------------

Pages may optionally begin with a metadata block. Here is an example:

::

    ---
    format: latex+lhs
    categories: haskell math
    toc: no
    title: Haskell and
      Category Theory
    ...

    \section{Why Category Theory?}

The metadata block consists of a list of key-value pairs, each on a
separate line. If needed, the value can be continued on one or more
additional line, which must begin with a space. (This is illustrated by
the “title” example above.) The metadata block must begin with a line
``---`` and end with a line ``...`` optionally followed by one or more
blank lines.

Currently the following keys are supported:

format
    Overrides the default page type as specified in the configuration
    file. Possible values are ``markdown``, ``rst``, ``latex``,
    ``html``, ``markdown+lhs``, ``rst+lhs``, ``latex+lhs``.
    (Capitalization is ignored, so you can also use ``LaTeX``, ``HTML``,
    etc.) The ``+lhs`` variants indicate that the page is to be
    interpreted as literate Haskell. If this field is missing, the
    default page type will be used.

categories
    A space or comma separated list of categories to which the page
    belongs.

toc
    Overrides default setting for table-of-contents in the configuration
    file. Values can be ``yes``, ``no``, ``true``, or ``false``
    (capitalization is ignored).

title
    By default the displayed page title is the page name. This metadata
    element overrides that default.

Creating a new page
-------------------

To create a new page, just create a wiki link that links to it, and
click the link. If the page does not exist, you will be editing it
immediately.

Reverting to an earlier version
-------------------------------

If you click the “history” button at the bottom of the page, you will
get a record of previous versions of the page. You can see the
differences between two versions by dragging one onto the other;
additions will be highlighted in yellow, and deletions will be crossed
out with a horizontal line. Clicking on the description of changes will
take you to the page as it existed after those changes. To revert the
page to the revision you’re currently looking at, just click the
“revert” button at the bottom of the page, then “Save”.

Deleting a page
---------------

The “delete” button at the bottom of the page will delete a page. Note
that deleted pages can be recovered, since a record of them will still
be accessible via the “activity” button on the top of the page.

Uploading files
===============

To upload a file–a picture, a PDF, or some other resource–click the
“upload” button in the navigation bar. You will be prompted to select
the file to upload. As with edits, you will be asked to provide a
description of the resource (or of the change, if you are overwriting an
existing file).

Often you may leave “Name on wiki” blank, since the existing name of the
file will be used by default. If that isn’t desired, supply a name. Note
that uploaded files *must* include a file extension (e.g. ``.pdf``).

If you are providing a new version of a file that already exists on the
wiki, check the box “Overwrite existing file.” Otherwise, leave it
unchecked.

To link to an uploaded file, just use its name in a regular wiki link.
For example, if you uploaded a picture ``fido.jpg``, you can insert the
picture into a (markdown-formatted) page as follows:
``![fido](fido.jpg)``. If you uploaded a PDF ``projection.pdf``, you can
insert a link to it using: ``[projection](projection.pdf)``.

Markup
======

This wiki’s pages are written in
`reStructuredText <http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html>`_. If
you’re not familiar with reStructuredText, you should start by looking
at the
`primer <http://docutils.sourceforge.net/docs/user/rst/quickstart.html>`_
and the `quick reference
guide <http://docutils.sourceforge.net/docs/user/rst/quickref.html>`_.
Note that not all reStructuredText constructs are currently supported.
Use the preview button if you’re in doubt.

Wiki links
----------

Links to other wiki pages are formed this way: ```Page Name <>`_``.
(Gitit converts markdown links with empty targets into wikilinks.)

To link to a wiki page using something else as the link text: either
```something else <Page+Name>`_`` or

::

    `something else`_

    .. _`something else`: Page Name

Note that page names may contain spaces and some special characters.
They need not be CamelCase. CamelCase words are *not* automatically
converted to wiki links.

Wiki pages may be organized into directories. So, if you have several
pages on wine, you may wish to organize them like so:

::

    Wine/Pinot Noir
    Wine/Burgundy
    Wine/Cabernet Sauvignon

Note that a wiki link ```Burgundy <>`_`` that occurs inside the ``Wine``
directory will link to ``Wine/Burgundy``, and not to ``Burgundy``. To
link to a top-level page called ``Burgundy``, you’d have to use
```Burgundy </Burgundy>`_``.

To link to a directory listing for a subdirectory, use a trailing slash:
```Wine/ <>`_`` will link to a listing of the ``Wine`` subdirectory.
