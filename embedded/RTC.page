Introduction
=============
A real-time clock (RTC) is a computer clock that keeps track of the current time. RTCs are also present in almost any electronic device that requires accurate time keeping. The real-time clock (RTC) embedded in STM32 microcontrollers acts as an independent BCD timer/ counter.
