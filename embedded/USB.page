 1. AHB(Advanced High-performance Bus)
 2. reference manual 30.3.2
    - DP/DM integrated pull-up and pull-down resistors controlled by the OTG_FS core depending on the current role of the device. As a peripheral, it enables the DP pull-up resistor to signal full-speed peripheral connections as soon as VBUS is sensed to be at a valid level (B-session valid). 
    - In host mode, pull-down resistors are enabled on both DP/DM. Pull-up and pull-down resistors are dynamically switched when the deviceâ€™s role is changed via the host negotiation protocol (HNP).
